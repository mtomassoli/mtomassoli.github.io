My name is Massimiliano Tomassoli. I'm more of a computer scientist than a statistician. I did *reverse engineering* and *exploit development* for many years, but I've recently become interested in *Artificial Intelligence*.

My main interest lies in *Reinforcement Learning* (*RL*) and *Simulation Optimization* or *Stochastic Optimization* or whatever you want to call it.

When I first started learning *Machine Learning*, I didn't like it because I thought the field was just a collection of methods one had to choose from. Then I discovered *Model-based ML* (AKA *Probabilistic Graphical Models*) and, finally, *Deep Learning* which, to me, is just *Differentiable ML*.

Maybe surprisingly, it's my interest in RL which led me to learn more about *Variational Inference* and the general idea of *Stochastic Optimization*.

## RL Group ([join!](https://discord.gg/ydeA9Uf))

I created a ***discussion group*** about RL on *Discord*. We also talk about other related topics such as *Variational Inference* and *Stochastic Optimization*. If you're interested, please join the group. You don't have to register if you want to just take a look. Just click [here](https://discord.gg/ydeA9Uf), choose a name and you're ready to go.
